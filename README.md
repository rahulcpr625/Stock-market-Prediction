#  Overview
This project is a machine learning-based stock market prediction system that uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to forecast future stock prices from historical market data. The model is built using Python and TensorFlow, with data collected through the Yahoo Finance API.

# The system analyzes past trends and generates future price predictions with interactive visualization support.
